# UNIT-TESTING
Unit testing felt intimidating at first, like something only "real developers" do. But this repo is proof that I’m learning to test my code, not just hope it works. I’m starting small: writing tests, breaking stuff on purpose, and watching how it all plays out. It’s less about being perfect and more about building habits that’ll make me better in the long run.
